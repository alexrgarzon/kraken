                <h1>Elevator Speech and Overview</h1>
                <p>Currently awesome sites exist such as TaskRabbit and AirTasker for Runners and Posters to interact and mutually benefit. Posters get tasks completed for them, and Runners get paid for doing them, it’s a win-win, and the best option for posters compared to the alternatives. Unfortunately, at Princeton and other colleges alike such sites haven’t been so popular among student communities and that’s a pity. We aim to create a service and site that is better targeted at college campuses by taking advantage of student trust, nearby convenience, and mutual knowledge of campus affairs. These three major factors are not present in the outside world, but a service wanting to flourish on college campuses must necessarily take advantage of them to succeed and that is what we plan to do!</p>
                <h1>Functionality</h1>
                <h2>Create Account</h2>

                <h2>Browse/Search for tasks</h2>
                <p>Based on locations (need a Princeton map); based on category of task; sorting by compensation, location distance, review scores</p>
                <h2>Post/Edit/Delete tasks</h2>
                <p>Once it’s accepted, you can’t edit it; if you change your mind you have to get in touch with the runner and figure out a way to resolve it. </p>
                <h2>Accept/Un-accept(undo acceptance) tasks</h2>
                <p>Users can decide to un-accept a task and that would re-list the task</p>
